# Portfolio Website

This is a clean, mobile-first personal portfolio built using plain HTML and CSS.

## Purpose
The goal of this site is to present:
- Real engineering projects
- Clear problem-solving ability
- Technical depth over visual gimmicks

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid)
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome

## Structure
- `index.html` – main portfolio page
- `styles.css` – global styles
- `projectX.html` – individual project case studies
- `images/` – optimized project images

## How to Customize
1. Replace all placeholder content with real projects.
2. Add detailed project pages explaining:
   - Problem
   - Constraints
   - Design decisions
   - Results
3. Keep code clean and readable.

## Important
This is **not** a design showcase.
It is a **technical credibility document**.

If a project cannot be explained clearly, it does not belong here.
